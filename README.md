	* Int doors, number of doors type integer
	* Int passengers, number of passengers type integer
* a parameterized constructor for all current and super instance variables
	* aModel, super from vehicle, model of the car
	* aPlate, super from vehicle, plate of the car
	* aMake, super from vehicle, make of the car
* getters for the instance variables in the class
	* getDoors, get number of doors
	* getPassengers, get number of passengers
* the toString method
	* returns #-doors [make] [model] with license [plate]
